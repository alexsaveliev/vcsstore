Revlog NG == version 1 (since Mercurial 0.9)

revision index: file extension .i

Two storage types:

-	each revision record is followed by patch data
	(next revision record starts after that data)

	This is for rather small files.

-	patch data corresponding to revisions are stored externally,
	in a file with same base name (stem), but extension `.d'

Index record format is described at http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RevlogNG

A data chunk starts either with

	u	uncompressed, skip 1 byte (the `u')

	0	uncompressed, dont skip

or
	x	zlib compressed

A data chunk consists of a collection of hunks, each starting
with three 4-byte values: start, end, length, followed by
the data.
